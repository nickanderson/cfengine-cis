* Center for Internet Security (CIS) policy framework

This is a framework to check Linux (Unix) installations for
CIS-compliance.

It will, if used with the CFEngine Enterprise Edition, collect the
implemented CIS benchmarks and report them into mission portal. For an
example how to use the mission portals inventory report with this,
refer to [[docs/mission_portal.org][this presentation]]. In case you are deploying the CFEngine
Community Edition, the easiest method to get a compliance report is to
used the cached mode of this framework, which will generate a file
=$(sys.workdir)/tmp/CIS.csv=.
