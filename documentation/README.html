<h1> CIS compliance package framework for Unix </h1>

This is a framework to check Linux (Unix) installations for
<a href="http://www.cisecurity.org"> CIS-compliance </a>.<br> </br>

It will, if used with the <em>CFEngine Enterprise Edition</em>, collect the implemented CIS benchmarks
and report them into mission portal. For an example how to use the mission portals inventory report
with this, refer to <a href="./mission_portal.html"> this presentation</a>.

In case you are deploying the <em>CFEngine Community Edition</em>, the easiest method to get a compliance report
is to used the cached mode of this framework, which will generate a file <kbd>$(sys.workdir)/tmp/CIS.csv</kbd>.
